# TO DO LIST

## Description

Duration: 1 week

This app once cloned and opened in VSCode and initialized, allows the user to manually input tasks that need to be completed. Upon entering the task, it is stored in a database that you can update and delete tasks from using the 'Complete' and 'Delete' buttons on the page when a task is inputted. Once a task is labeled as complete, it will have styling applied to it that crosses out that task in the list designating it as completed.
